Hi, Iâ€™m Jhuni Shukla! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a passionate software developer with hands-on experience in building robust web applications using Django, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over time, I have developed a strong interest in creating practical solutions like Vendor Management Systems, Visitor Management Systems, Task Delegation Systems, and Grievance & Complaint Systems that improve business operations.

Iâ€™m constantly learning new technologies and refining my skills in full-stack web development. I enjoy collaborating on projects that challenge me and allow me to deliver value through clean, maintainable code.

If you want to connect, collaborate, or just say hi, feel free to reach out!
